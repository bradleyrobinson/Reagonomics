# Reaganomics
A Platformer game that is super fun, if you're willing to get Pygame working right. Try to catch the money as it trickles down without too much of it getting to the working class!

To get it working:
Install Python 2.7, 32-bit
Then download Pygame from pygame.org or through your package manager in Linux. Then everything should work!
